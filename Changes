Revision history for Path-Extended-Tiny

0.05 2014/10/10
  - replaced recurse with the code in Path::Extended, which silenced
    "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" warnings with fork()
    (this was actually an issue of File::Find it used)

0.04 2014/10/07
  - requires IO::Handle 1.25

0.03 2014/09/30
  - fixed a case when an absolute path is passed to file/subdir
    (Unlike Path::Class/Path::Tiny, Path::Extended doesn't simply
    append the path to the original and replaces the original with
    the new absolute path.)

0.02 2014/09/05
  - subsumes requires Path::Tiny 0.048

0.01 2014/09/03
  - initial release
