NAME
  Path::Extended::Tiny - a Path::Tiny wrapper for Path::Extended
  compatibility

SYNOPSIS
      use Path::Extended::Tiny;

      # These objects have the (almost) same methods as Path::Extended
      # but use Path::Tiny internally.
      my $file = file('path/to/file.txt');
      my $dir  = dir('path/to/somewhere');

      # These objects autoload Path::Tiny methods as well.
      $file->spew('write something to the path');
      $dir->remove_tree;

      # As for conflicting methods, append _pt to use Path::Tiny ones.
      $file->slurp_pt;

DESCRIPTION
  This module reimplements important interfaces of Path::Extended
  with Path::Tiny to help migration. If you have some utilities that
  have used Path::Extended and exposed its objects to other
  modules/applications, this would help you and your users.

  If you write something new, just use Path::Tiny.

METHODS
  See Path::Extended and Path::Tiny for details.

NOTABLE INCOMPATIBLE METHODS
  The following methods have incompatibility between Path::Extended
  and Path::Tiny. For easier migration, you might want to replace
  them with the ones with _pt suffix step by step. When everything
  is ready, replace Path::Extended::Tiny with Path::Tiny and remove
  _pt.
